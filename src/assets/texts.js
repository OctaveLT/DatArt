    title: 'What is DatArt',
    intro: `This project made in Vue.js aimed to extract pixel colors from the uploaded video and re-sort them in order to build artistical shapes called circle, 
            lines, and rose. You can adjust the color threshold depending on your video colors. Moreover you can tune every shape and download them at the end or 
            during the process.`,
    about: 'About the creator:',
    myself: `I am Octave Le Tullier, a double-degree student in Computer Science at KTH & Telecom Paris (2022). I enjoy doing sports and creating websites in my free time. 
    As data visualization and arts has always piqued my interests, I started developing this project! I hope you'll enjoy it and save lots of your memories in art-shapes! :)`

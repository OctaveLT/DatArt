# DatArt

Project in Vue.js aiming to create art from the colors of videos. Remember your favorite videos through more abstract images!

## Shapes

3 shapes are currently available:

- Circle/Donut
- Lines
- Rose

## Settings

The 3 different shapes can be tuned thanks to the settings top-bar.

You are now able to change: 

- The background color of the canvas
- The inside and outside radius of the circle shape.
- The angle of the lines shape
- And even the width of the rose shape!
